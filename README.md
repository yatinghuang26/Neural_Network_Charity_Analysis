# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to familiarize with neural networks and using them along with TensorFlow in Python in order to determine the success of donations to charity. Our main process was preprocessing and processing our data to get ready for the neural network model, compile, train, and evaluate the model during Python, and optimize the model.

Results: 
  - Our target variables are our hidden layers that comprise of nerons. We are hoping adjusting hidden layers would help strengthen the accuracy of the model.
  - Features include the activation functions, such as ReLU and Sigmoid. The functions help speed up the training process.
  - We tried increasing the amount of layers, switching around the activation functions, and changing the number of epochs in order to help the model succeed. Unforunately, we were still not able to reach 75% accuracy.

Summary: 
Because the model was not able to reach 75%, it is definitely underperforming. A recommendation for improvement would be trying the model out with other variables in order for it to be able to work with more data. This could include testing the model regularly as we gradually add more and more date to it. This way, we are more likely to catch any errors and be more efficient in making necessary adjustments and improvements.
